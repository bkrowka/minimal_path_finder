# Minimal Path Finder

## Description
Minimal Path Finder is a C++ program that reads a matrix from a text file, calculates its minimal paths, visualizes it, and exports the result to a separate file. It allows arbitrary editing of the loaded data before starting generation. For testing the correctness of the algorithm, the ability to load a random matrix with user-specified parameters has also been implemented.

## Technologies
Programming Language: C++
GUI: wxWidgets 3.2.4
IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition

## Usage
1. Load a matrix from a text file.
2. Edit the loaded data as needed.
3. Start the path finding process.
4. The program will calculate the minimal paths, visualize them, and export the results to a separate file.
5. For testing purposes, you can also load a random matrix with parameters specified by you.

## Installation
Please ensure you have the correct version of wxWidgets and Microsoft Visual Studio installed. Then, clone the repository and open the project in Visual Studio. Build the project and run the generated executable.

**Note:** To compile the program, it is necessary to connect the wxWidgets library version 3.2.4 to the project. A link to the instructional video, which will assist you in this process, can be found below.
